`cardNumber` - A string value for the full credit card number. This is a required parameter.

`validThru` - A string value for the validity date of the card. It must be in the format "mm/yy". This is a required parameter.

`topLeftColor` - A Color value for the top-left gradient color of the card. The default value is Colors. purple.

`doesSupportNfc` - A boolean value to indicate if the card supports NFC feature. The default value is `true`.

#### Example
``` dart
CreditCardUi(
  cardHolderFullName: 'John Doe',
  cardNumber: '1234567812345678',
  validFrom: '01/23',
  validThru: '01/28',
  topLeftColor: Colors.blue,
  doesSupportNfc: false, // Set to true if card support NFC
),
```
This will create a credit card user interface with the cardholder's name, card number, validity dates, and blue gradient colors. The card will not have the NFC icon.



#### Custom Gradient

``` dart
CreditCardUi(
  cardHolderFullName: 'John Doe',
  cardNumber: '1234567812345678',
  validThru: '10/24',
  topLeftColor: Colors.red,
  bottomRightColor: Colors.purpleAccent,
)
```
This will create a credit card user interface with the red to yellow gradient.

If you want to scale the card, use `scale:` property.

If you set less than 1, card size will be reduced,
if you set greater than 1, card size will be increased.


``` dart
CreditCardUi(
  scale: 0.6, // <-- this will make smaller than the normal size
  cardHolderFullName: 'John Doe',
  cardNumber: '1234567812345678',
  validThru: '10/24',
  topLeftColor: Colors.red,
  bottomRightColor: Colors.purpleAccent,
)
```
